# DontCrash
This is the Don't Crash main menu mod for Cities: Skylines.
See http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=726792339 for more information (workshop item visibility is currently limited to Steam friends).

Don't Crash is worth a try if you use many custom assets, and:
- the game crashes on startup before Main Menu, or
- the game crashes on Quit to Main Menu, or
- Main Menu takes a long time to load.

Don't Crash is inactive while you play. It does not attempt to fix in-game issues.
Don't Crash is not compatible with Improved Assets Panel.
